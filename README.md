This website was created during my learning courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its purpose was to provide an online image for a friend who owns a removals business. 
However, the project came to a halt because my friend's plans changed.
Let's discuss the website itself.
The main background image was downloaded from internet, but was modified by me using Photoshop, to include the business name on the van.
While contemplating a business theme, the idea of a city background came to me.Subsequently, I searched for overview photos and added them to the body background.
The images in the 'Our Services' section were edited by me to visually represent professional packages. 
The 'Get a Free Quote' section functions as an online form, with all submissions sent to the corresponding email address.

** Considering it's my first website ever, I believe it looks okay. Thank you for taking the time to read this. **
